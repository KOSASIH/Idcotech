# IDCOTECH

Identification system for the molecular basis of coronary heart disease powered by AI ( Artificial Intelligence ) and machine learning algorithms.

# Description

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in industrialized countries and a major cause of disability. This is caused by coronary heart disease (CHD), which is not only an individual burden, but also an economic one. The diagnosis of CHD and its development are complex processes that involve multiple risk factors that have been identified through epidemiological studies (smoking, obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia). Each risk factor has its own determinant and subtle mechanism that makes it difficult to diagnose accurately and prevent clinically.

IDCOTECH is a Identification system for the molecular basis of coronary heart disease powered by AI ( Artificial Intelligence ) and machine learning algorithms. Using these tools we can identify the root cause of your problem, provide a solution and a mechanism to access further treatment and management through our online platform.

IDCOTECH is a medical technology company that specializes in the identification system for the molecular basis of coronary heart disease powered by AI ( Artificial Intelligence ) and machine learning algorithms. This identification system allows us to predict individuals at risk for coronary heart disease using their genetic information.

The IDCOTECH is an identification system for the molecular basis of coronary heart disease powered by AI ( Artificial Intelligence ) and machine learning algorithms. IDCOTECH is a web based platform that can be accessed from anywhere in the world.

The IDCOTECH platform will provide a systematic approach to identifying risk factors associated with coronary heart disease. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a resource for physicians and researchers to use as a diagnostic tool for identifying risk factors for coronary heart disease.

The IDCOTECH platform is based on the hypothesis that there are certain biomarkers present in blood samples of patients with coronary heart disease which can be used as diagnostic indicators for predicting the risk of developing coronary heart disease.

There are many factors which may affect the outcome of any given patient, including their genetic makeup, lifestyle habits such as diet and exercise, family history and other environmental factors such as air pollution or stress levels. It is difficult to pinpoint exactly what causes each individual case of CHD because these factors are often hard to measure or quantify accurately enough for clinical purposes.

The company focuses on providing solutions that help improve patient care by providing the most accurate diagnosis possible. This will allow physicians to provide better treatment options for their patients, which will greatly improve patient outcomes and quality of life.

# Mission

To revolutionize the field of atherosclerosis, leading the fight against this scourge affecting thousands of patients around the world.

# Value Proposition

We are solution providers for aiding for fast and cheap diagnosis for patients. We provide a high level of accuracy diagnosis system with no side effects and cost-effective tools for patient management. Our system is user-friendly and proven accurate in various research studies. Let us know if you want to join our revolution of more accurate diagnoses, more public awareness, faster recognition of epidemics, less need for surgeries and overall improved lives from the disease.

AI based system for identifying the molecular basis of coronary heart disease. Covers cellular mechanisms, biochemistry and clinical endpoints of CVD . IDCOTECH : Identification system for the molecular basis of coronary heart disease powered by AI ( Artificial Intelligence ) and machine learning algorithms. We do this in two steps: 1st -Using "big data analysis, we generate a unique ID pool consisting of millions of DNA sequences. 2nd -We use a proprietary, multi-layered neural network to identify the DNA sequences that are most closely linked with CVD/coronary heart disease.

We are generating a new paradigm in the treatment of cardiometabolic diseases by bringing an artificial intelligence based system to the point of care. Our technology is based on a deep learning platform based on convolution neural network-generative adversarial network as well as other state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.

The IDCOTECH Data Analytics Platform can help identify coronary artery disease early and act upon it, helping to save the lives of millions of people who are unlikely to receive proper medical attention in the near future due to:

- Limited awareness
- Lack of funds for treatment
- Lack of access to hospitals.

We offer innovative solutions for identification of pathogens, particularly bacteria and viruses for the detection of diseases like coronary heart disease :

a) Identification system for the molecular basis of coronary heart disease
b) We provide innovative solutions for identification of pathogens, particularly bacteria and viruses for the detection of diseases like coronary heart disease with our high-throughput technologies using artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning techniques.

Intelligent Diagnosis for Coronary Heart Disease Powered by AI: IDCOTECH uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms to accurately predict the molecular profile of a patient's coronary heart disease. It is a unique platform by which physicians can make better decisions to reduce morbidity and mortality rates of patients. IDCOTECH also allows on-demand access to top-notch cardiologists from across the globe via video consultation, providing them with a more convenient, remote patient care solution.

IDCOTECH is the first Accelerator project focused on molecular identification of coronary heart disease.(CHD) Our solution combines Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms to provide doctors and patients with comprehensive information about CHD. For example, IDCOTECH could detect Alport syndrome—a hereditary disease which results in heart failure—by analyzing retinal images. Many small molecules, proteins, or lipids can be identified in a fast and simple way by our system.
